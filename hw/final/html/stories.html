      <h2>Everything Happens for a Reason</h2>
      <p>Everything happens for a reason. What a vastly encompassing word: everything. Everything is off-white porcelain toilet bowls filled with vomit, swirls of acidic yellows and greens and browns, liquified manifestations of anxieties, the ones that cause paralysis, sending shock waves of hormones throughout the body, screaming for help, praying for you to cease whatever action is causing insurmountable amounts of stress. But it’s for a reason.
You know when you look at your reflection, and you can almost feel the emptiness through the mirror? As if the crippling void from within cleverly disguised itself as light waves, coaxing your rods and cones into creating an image of hopelessness and desolation? Though, do not worry, this is for a reason. Do not ask me what the reason is, for I do not know, nor does anyone.
Maybe you’re a single mother fallen victim to systemic poverty, or a young person fighting your core to love a different person than the one you do, or a highly successful cardiac surgeon making more money in a year than some people do in a lifetime, and maybe you experience a daily struggle to repress your burning self-hatred just long enough to pull yourself out of bed, and maybe somebody somewhere told you this is for a reason, and you believed it for a little while, that these struggles are blessings in disguises, though you don’t understand how feeling like drowning in air could bear any resemblance to something even remotely positive.
Do you remember the feeling when you believed in something? God, people, yourself, anything, anything at all, the feeling that one foot should be placed in front of the other, the feeling you felt when everything didn’t feel as if it were working against you, when living just felt like a natural occurrence and not something you had to talk yourself into each morning, or night (on the nights when insomnia preys upon your pathetic vulnerability).
People say that everything happens for a reason, though what they are really saying is that everything should happen for a reason, that bad things should happen because of a purpose and not just because they’re bad things. They say this because it keeps them going. Because sometimes life sucks, and sometimes it sucks for no conceivable purpose other than because life is allowed to, it is allowed to do whatever it wants, as that is the nature of life, the ruler of all natural phenomena (at least as far as we know), and that thought is scary, as purpose drives action, and so without a purpose for living what else would keep us alive?
Everything does not happen for a reason. This is something you have known for quite some time as a chronic sufferer, who knows that things can (and often do) become worse, even when you try your best to be nice to people for the sake of maintaining your karmic energy points. It is okay to convince yourself every once in a while that things do happen for a purpose, because maybe that helps you get through the excruciatingly long day, even if deep down you know the truth.
Analyzing life’s whys will do nothing but cause more pain. You will drive yourself crazy trying to figure out possible reasons, as those are the causes of all things, and you will ruin your self-esteem convincing yourself that the reason your father had a heart attack is because you didn’t give up your seat on the metro to that pregnant woman because you were tired and hungover and so now the universe is trying to teach you the sanctity of life.
Stop asking questions. It doesn’t matter why you are here, because you know you can’t be here forever, and so there is no logical reason to spend time worrying about this. Life is terrible to people sometimes, and I am sorry it has been terrible to you, and you do not deserve the terrible things that have happened to you. See these things as opportunities, as changes in pace, new abilities to make new decisions because yes, you can still make those, you are the reason, you have always been the reason. Everything is happening, but you are happening as well, so let yourself happen. Be.

  <h2>Maybe There Isn't an Answer</h2>
  <p>Maybe there is no secret to life. No enlightened mantra, no righteous path, no tier of self-actualization. Maybe we are all events in a chain sequence, following one another consecutively until we fall out of order. Maybe you are running away. Maybe there is no away.
The questions that live in your eyes do not believe in the present. Only the next and the next.
I know you wonder when this started. Or if it would ever end. I know you’re getting tired. Tired from the inside. Every time you decide to run, your sternum caves in a little deeper, pressing down and down on your heart so that it may burst.
You know you are intelligent. That you are sure of. Maybe you’ve even into a prestigious university, the ones parents brag to cashiers at the grocery store about, innovatively finding relevancy among heads of cabbage and cooking oil, Oh, I’ve got to start thinking of easy recipes to give my daughter while she’s in college, [calculated smile insinuating desire for further conversation], yes, she’ll be attending XXXXXXX in the fall, we’re all very happy for her, and things of that nature. I know your desire to drop out is in fact not because of your lack of intellectual fitness, but rather the mundane style of traditional learning environments, the books, the exams, the professors, you hate it, you hate it all, and so you believe dropping out and moving to a large, disgustingly gentrified city and getting a job at a shitty diner to support yourself as you pursue your quite less mundane dream of becoming an artist will fill the void, the one you don’t admit to yourself is there out of fear of becoming a walking cliche.
You know you are talented. That you are sure of. Maybe your paintings were showcased in your high school’s art gallery every year, or your AP 2-D Art teacher told you you had great potential, but what was potential if not a could be and not a reality? The questions eat you alive, you run yourself ragged in pursuit of their answers, and each answer lead you closer and closer to the conclusion that maybe there were in fact no answer at all, which only makes you think of new questions, for it cannot be that easy, and there must be a light at the end of the dark tunnel that is existence.
You think of what answer you’d like to find. Maybe a woman, old and wise, will find you at a coffee shop, give you a cryptic message that through a long series of challenges and trials will reveal itself to be the mantra you are destined to live out, an absolute truth, she had read it somewhere in her freshman year English class.
But life is in fact life, and not book assignments in freshman year English classes, and the more passionate your intentions become, so boring do their outcomes remain. I know you think dropping out and focusing on your art would fulfill her interests, and after doing so, you soon find that it only makes people your age think you are more interesting, but you do not tell them that you hate your job and nobody wants to buy your art, you construct elusive sentences that make you sound like you have it all figured it out, and you have them convinced, though you don’t, you don’t know anything at all except that running make things feel weightless, at least for a little while.
Maybe there is no secret to life. I know you are tired of wanting to be different. I know you miss the regular. The promised. Things like Tuesday will follow Monday, and dinner will follow lunch and night will follow day. I know you can’t remember what made you hate order so much. Order is comforting. Safe. Order is how humans advance themselves. Maybe you even think the pursuit of chaos was quite ordered. Many people followed the steps, and nobody’s really sure if they ever reached the end, though they did seem to spend a large amount of time significantly unhappy. Maybe you’re tired of wanting to be unhappy in the name of knowledge.
Maybe there is truth in the mundane. Maybe every answer does not have to be no answer. Maybe Tuesday should follow Monday and dinner should follow lunch and night should follow day. Maybe she could live with that. Maybe you don’t have to run. Maybe you could be still and live. Honestly. Truthfully. Artfully. You want to breathe.
Maybe by this point you realize that you do have the answer. Maybe you’ve had it all along. Maybe you don’t know if it was the answer you wanted. It probably wasn’t; it felt too easy. But maybe that is the whole point. Maybe things are supposed to feel easy sometimes and maybe that’s okay.
