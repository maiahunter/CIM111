        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>maia hunter, the creator of maia’s musings, has long expressed passions for the english language. from books to poetry, she has indulged in the beauty of the written word for as long as she can remember. it was only a matter of time, then, before the birth of maia’s musings, a blog dedicated to reflect her own worldview and interests, from personal poetry and essays to blog posts surrounding topics such as music and lifestyle. she hopes her words will resonate with at least one curious wanderer who finds his or herself upon this site.</p>
