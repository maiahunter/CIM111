      <h2>The Harder They Play, the Harder They Lose: A Critical Analysis of Relationship between Social Mobility and Gender in Postcolonial Jamaica</h2>
      <p>In Perry Henzel’s The Harder They Come, Elsa’s proclamation that “every game [she] play[s], [she] lose[s]” metaphorizes the systemic ‘game’ of social mobility in postcolonial Jamaica. The film represents women as second class to men; thus, women in the film, as well as in historical 1970s Jamaica, never play the same ‘game’ as their male counterparts. In this essay, I will deconstruct the game’s structure and assert the role of women within it.
To fully understand the unevenness of the playing field of the game of which Elsa is referring to, we must first analyze the game itself. The game’s beginnings date back to colonial Jamaica, a land of rich exports. This country became the epitome of Caribbean mercantilism, in which the island’s resources—and people—were exploited and commodified as to stimulate Western European economy. As mercantilism accumulated more capital, so it did technology; these developments then led to urbanization, which birthed the social hierarchy very much like that portrayed in the film. Thomas D. Boswell, in his journal article “Characteristics and Processes of Urbanization in the Caribbean” describes how a mercantile system led to the development of urbanization:
...the European colonization of the islands in the Caribbean was established for purposes of trade under the mercantile system that prevailed from the 15th through 19th centuries. Port cities were established...These towns grew into the primate cities of their respective islands and served as the gateways for trade between their agricultural hinterlands and Europe. Growth and innovations spread from the port cities inland until an urban hierarchy developed, especially on the larger islands. Thus, Europeans and their trade represented the outside force driving the mercantile system, as the smaller settlements diffused from the primate port cities inland, in a fashion downward through the urban hierarchy.
This system, although dating back centuries before the film’s setting, plays a crucial role in the way Jamaican society in the film is structured—Kingston, a large port city, is filled with crime and poverty, as it contains generations most directly influenced by mercantilism and thus suffer the most social damage.
To understand Jamaica’s past is to understand the structure of post-colonial Jamaica’s ‘game’. The players are Jamaicans living in a society like mercantile Jamaica, but without colonial rule or structure. To win the game is to find a useful place among this loosely structured society, and to be useful is to be deemed useful by one of the driving systems in Jamaica who ultimately control the game: economy, politics, entertainment, and religion. Thus, although social mobility appears to be linear, the game’s structure allows for very little actual movement, and often players do not end up much further than where they began.
Elsa, the voice of the statement about the game, is a young woman raised by a preacher from very young and consequently has very strict Christian moral values. She lives a simple life singing in the choir, minding Preacher and his house, and keeping a close relationship with God. In fact, when Elsa meets Ivan, the film’s protagonist, she tells him she will only go for a ride with him if he is a “true Christian” (21:35). Elsa places value upon moral righteousness consciously because of her faith; however, in the context of the game, Elsa’s values are parallel her strategies. Because Elsa is a woman, she has much fewer moves than her male counterparts. Thus, it is in her benefit to ‘play it safe’ and take calculated risks to ensure that she wins. For Elsa, and many women in Jamaica during this era, winning the game means finding a man who can win his version of the game and share his winnings with her.
Society has both directly and implicitly groomed Elsa to believe that she belongs to the men around her. Throughout the film, Elsa is objectified, and she internalizes it. At its beginning, the film implicitly states that it is likely Elsa will have a mature relationship with the preacher once she becomes old enough, although she is much younger than him. When Longa, a friend and likely helper to preacher, catches Ivan flirting with Elsa, he tells him to “mind how [he] play[s] in preacher’s garden. [Preacher] tend to that cherry tree a long time. When fruit ripe if preacher don’t pick it. [Longa] feel[s] [he] will pick it. Look like it soon ripe too.” (22:17). Longa likens Elsa to a fruit waiting to be picked and warns Ivan that because Preacher has ‘tended’ to her, it is his right to own her, and if Preacher chooses not to, he is second in line. Ivan, however, ignores this warning and continues to pursue Elsa. When Preacher takes notice, he grows angry with Ivan and lashes out on him. Elsa’s friends from church observe Preacher’s behavior and begin to tease her, stating: “Preacher is a man of Lord, but he is a man all the same. And the Lord say ‘Go ye forth and multiply’, and preacher don’t multiply yet.” (25:40). This implies that Preacher’s frustration is sexually driven and that the conflict between he and Ivan is subliminally motivated by both of their desires to have power over Elsa.
As the film progresses, Elsa’s feelings for Ivan cloud her ability to make smart moves. She begins to believe that Ivan’s emotional provision is just as beneficial as the pragmatic provision of which she has always desired. Ivan, who dreams of making it big in the music industry and thus unconventionally winning his ‘game’, coaxes Elsa into helping him record in the church against preacher’s wishes, telling her that “[her] life [is] finished with [Preacher], but it starts with [him]… [she is] not going to live in preacher’s house all [her] life...[she has] to make up [her] mind...between [him] and Preacher.” (35:48). While on the surface, Ivan’s assertion seems romantic, it is power driven; Ivan wants to fulfill the trope of an important musician who has a woman blindly taking care of him; he is using Elsa as a pawn to boost his own ego and thus help him to win his ‘game’.
Elsa continues this role as pawn when she begins to develop a relationship between Pedro and his son, Man-I. When Jose tells the police director that Pedro’s wife has been killed by the army, he tells him to “find someone to take her place” (49:25). Soon after, Ivan enters the ganja trade business and Elsa adopts the role as caregiver to Man-I, who deals with sickness spells. It can be justly asserted, then, that Elsa unknowingly fulfills the police director’s prophesy. This furthers the idea that women are playing an entirely different game than men. The context of wife in the film has little to do with love; it is about upholding the responsibilities that come with being a wife. The police director very simply tells Pedro to find a replacement because he understands that women are expendable and exist solely to benefit men who are doing ‘important’ work.
It is until the very end of the film, when Elsa states that “every game [she] plays, [she] lose[s]”, that the low height of the glass ceiling the game provides is fully shown. Elsa, who is tired, exasperated, and without a stable life, is out of moves; thus, she must start back at the beginning. She returns to preacher to disclose Ivan’s whereabouts in exchange for stability, which is a prize she has worked hard to achieve.
Although simple, Elsa’s statement is one of large magnitude. It is unthinkable for Elsa to ever feel as if she can decide for herself; her life is driven by strategy and she constantly chooses between circumstances already presented to her. Elsa is given little to no character development and has very little points of dialogue; in fact, her role as supporting character exists to progress the story of Ivan, the main character. The film uses Elsa’s character to represent the experience of Jamaican women, who are virtually invisible. In his journal article titled The Role of Women in the Caribbean, Dorian Powell describes the cultural significance of Elsa’s experience:
Much criticism has been directed at how the “integration of women in development” thrust has been conceived and pursued. It tends to view women as passive recipients rather than active participants in the process of change. For one, it has been felt that there has been a tendency to generalize about women and so ignore the enormous validation in the situation from society to society and even among groups of women within societies...women have been viewed largely as passive creatures to be influenced by change agents, instead of being seen as active participants in the process of change.
Although Powell’s assertion refers to societal views on women’s role in progression and development on a large scale, it can be paralleled acutely to Henziell’s film. Elsa plays no active role in any change in her life; she is expected to adapt to whatever situation needs her attention the most.
Elsa’s return to preacher symbolizes much more than just an act of exasperation. It is an act of defeat, but one of pragmatism as well. By the end of the film, Elsa walks out virtually unscathed from the dramatic destruction Ivan is destined to face for the simple fact that she has accepted her fate, unlike him.
In the context of the film, Elsa can never have her own dreams or aspirations. Her entire life is dependent upon contingencies solely because she is a woman, a physical and emotional support system for men. Elsa showcases this understanding when exasperatedly talking to Ivan after a long day of searching for work: “Ivan, you’re a dreamer.” (52:38). Elsa must maintain a practical mentality for the sake of her own sanity and well-being.
The audience never gets to see Elsa in the context of a human being. Throughout the duration of the film, she is a helper and caregiver who is only useful for stability, sex, and finance. Elsa, however, recognizes that every time she strays from these roles, hoping to seek a better life, she is only met with disappointment. Thus, ironically, it is at the point when Elsa makes the point of her assertion that—for the first time in her life—she has played a game and won, simply by coming to terms with her role in society as a woman.

<h2>Heading South: An Analysis of the Systemic Relationship Between Toxic White Women and Haitian Society</h2>
<p>Danny Lafèrrieré’s Heading South uses obvious irony to exemplify the varying caricatures of dangerously ignorant white women in efforts to showcase the toxicity of these women’s frustrations caused by their experiences as sexually rejected beings in Western society. This toxicity reveals itself among the exploitative Haitian transactional sex industry, of which Western white women benightedly relabel as an industry of negotiated pleasure, or even ‘love’. The women project their insecurities surrounding their sexual undesirability onto the powerless--young Haitian boys turned prostitutes—because it allows for guiltless abuse; they dehumanize these children to the point of complete sexual objectification, and so have no empathy for them. This, in turn, leads to a systemic exploitation of black children, specifically those of Haitian origin. Thus, Lafèrrieré’s narrative proves that tourism and exploitation are synonymous in that Western culture has rebranded oppression in favor of fetishization and escapism.
The 1970s, the presumed time period of Heading South’s setting, was a time in which sex tourism was thriving in Haiti and the Caribbean. The main perpetuators of this industry were older white women, typically European, who fetishized young black Caribbean boys and thus offered hefty payment in exchange for sex (Independent UK). Fetishization of black people has long existed in colonial history; there are overwhelming amounts of evidence showing continuous rape and commodification of black bodies over the course of the last few centuries. Over time, this fetishization has integrated with other ideas, such as escapism. Older white women, likely ostracized from sexual culture and regarded as past the age of prime sexual candidacy, used fetishization to escape from their disheartening realities of sexual dissatisfaction. Because these women did not actually see young black boys as children, but rather as utilities--a byproduct of systemic racism--it was easy for them to sexualize them, especially when an entity like the transactional sex industry encouraged such behavior. While this industry attracted foreign tourists and provided local prostitutes with more than decent pay, it did so at the cost of traumatizing these boys, and in the context of Lafèrrieré’s narrative, cost them their lives.
Heading South describes seemingly different characters that work as a collective to shine light on different angles of the same portrait. Three white women’s testimonies are given after a seventeen-year-old gigolo, Legba, is apparently found murdered on the beach. The first woman, Brenda, is a religious woman from the American South who is obviously sexually dissatisfied in her marriage, as she mentions early in her testimony that she has “lived for twenty-five years with a man named Bill who hasn’t touched her more than a grand total of eight times in all those years” (Lafèrrieré 136). Brenda is additionally a clear product of internalized sexism that dominates the American South, as she refers to her husband quite frequently during her testimony though he is not physically present. In fact, it is Brenda’s husband, Bill, who first turns her attention to Legba, giving her his permission to engage in sexual activities with him. Brenda’s grotesquely vivid recount of her first encounter with Legba is filled with adjectives that objectify and belittle him: she refers to him as “this body that was being offered to [her] on a platter”, and refers to his genitals as “a long, black sword” (141-142). Brenda gives very limited detail, however, on Legba’s reaction to the encounter, the most detailed being that afterward “his eyes were a red and timid and a bit frightened” (142). Brenda’s lack of intimacy within her own marriage causes an almost animalistic desire for intimate acceptance. She cries, relieved, when the encounter is over (143), seemingly absolving the sexual void previously plaguing her. It is worth noting that this absolution came at the expense of the sexual exploitation of an underaged black boy, raising the ethical question of whether it is the responsibility of these children to resolve traumas experienced exclusively by adults, though that is the exact promise of the transactional sex industry. Perhaps the most dangerous byproduct of Brenda’s ignorance, however, is her closing statement, which details her plans of traveling to other Caribbean islands in pursuit of other young black boys (150). Brenda seems unphased by the fact that a child has lost his life, or that his role in the transactional sex industry is the likely cause of his death. In fact, Brenda’s only explicit concern throughout her testimony is of her orgasms, and the way she craves black children to achieve them.
The second white woman in Lafèrrieré’s work, Ellen, is characteristically much different than Brenda. She is a long-time contemporary literature professor at Vassar College, a prestigious liberal arts university. Ellen, however, is acutely aware of the societal hyper-sexualization of young American white women, stating that although she is a professor, she really “teach[es] stuck-up little bitches to keep their knees together so that they can trap husbands” (136), implying that education is merely a euphemism for the reinstatement of sexist values.  Additionally, she refers to her hometown as a “snobbish whore”, implicating the idea that everyone where she is from exudes these sexist behaviors, (140) and herself as “Ellen the Cynic” (145), as she vehemently and bitterly disagrees with these sentiments. Ellen’s crude description of her daily thoughts and experiences inherently imply that she should have a basic understanding of the moral boundaries surrounding sex and exploitation, but her actions while visiting Port-au-Prince suggest the exact opposite. Ellen’s contradictory nature is rooted in her desire for escape; it is precisely the moral incorrectness of her affair with Legba that attracts him to her. She states that “with [Legba she] was no longer Ellen the Cynic, [she] was a little twit who wanted nothing more than to be touched in the right places” (145). Ellen’s infatuation with fantasy and escapism demonstrates the toxic nature of tourism, an argument that is further detailed in Jamaica Kincaid’s A Small Place. Kincaid’s work addresses the psychological need for escape that propels tourism forward, describing that “[tourists] are thinking of the hard and cold and dark and long days [they] spent working in North America (or worse, Europe), earning some money so that [they] could stay in [the Caribbean]” (Kincaid 4). As Kincaid notes, a tourist like Ellen is exhausted with her intellectual status, as it isolates her from American men and leads to her sexual dissatisfaction. Ellen states that she “had always intimidated American men, who are supposed to be the most powerful in the world, at least in terms of economic and political power” (Lafèrrieré 145), demonstrating that it is her educated nature that drives men away from her. Ellen, then, is willfully ignorant; she is fully aware she is having sex with a child, even describing him as a “young arrogant kid” (148), but casts aside her morality in the name of selfish indulgence, a phenomenon that the tourism industry has normalized.
The third white woman described in Heading South, Sue, is distinctively different than the first two women mentioned in that she is physically larger than the Western standard of attractiveness. Her desire to come to the South in pursuit of sexual endeavors stems from her perceived undesirability in the eyes of white American men. What is particularly ignorant about Sue, though, is her racist ideology; she believes that black American men are violent against white people, but believes black Haitian men are passive. History, however, marks the Haitian Revolution as notably violent (blackpast.org) and would suggest that black Haitian history is even more anti-white than black American history. Though Sue is intimately involved with an adult Haitian man, Neptune, she is still complicit in the viciously exploitative products of the transactional sex industry; at the end of her testimony, she explains that she believes one of the other white women killed Legba, “all because of the contempt Northern men have for women of their own race” (148). Sue’s assertion implies that white women must turn to the transactional sex of the South to fulfill their sexual needs because Northern white men do not want them, which justifies the notion that white women deserve to exploit young black children.
The fourth and final suspect in Heading South is perhaps the most different than the others. Albert is a native Haitian, born from a long line of militant Haitian nationalists. Albert notably describes his grandfather as having a great distrust in white people (Lafèrrieré 144), though he works as a steward at the hotel at which white women stay during their visit to Port-au-Prince. During his introduction into the story, Albert describes the toxicity of sex tourism in Haiti, stating that “there was a time when [people] had morals...[now he sees] lost women, animals lusting after blood and sperm” (144), showing promise that he understands the true problem at hand, though he later proves his ignorance by stating that it is Legba’s fault for driving these women to the point of insanity (144). Albert’s ignorance is rooted in internalized self-hatred; instead of blaming the white women’s clear abuse of power and exploitation of the poor, young, and black, he chooses to blame the young black boy for being ‘too enticing’. Albert is not a stupid man, though; his ignorance is a coping mechanism, a sort of rationalization in order to avoid facing the cold truth that he, too, plays a role in the oppression of his own people, despite his roots. When Albert describes his encounter with Legba’s almost unconscious body, he mentions that “it was like [he] was watching [his] double” (149), demonstrating that Albert sees a bit of himself in Legba’s experience, though he chooses to concede to the weight of the systems playing against him.
Lafèrrieré’s narrative employs these extensive uses of blatant irony and contradiction to address the blurred lines between seemingly distinct relationships that would commonly be regarded to have no grey area. Objectively, the white women depicted in the story do not outwardly exhibit nymphomaniacal tendencies; they seem to be average women from across the North American region, each with ideologies that should create a moral compass within them, from religion to intellectual philosophy to the experience of being fat in a place where it is socially unacceptable. They are socially aware, educated enough members of a self-proclaimed ‘developed’ society to understand the severity of their toxic actions, though they each still turn a blind eye. These women let their desires of pleasure and acceptance overtake their rationales and are systemically privileged enough to act on this desire in ways that benefits the exploitative transactional sex industry.
Heading South tells a story from all perspectives but one. Legba, who is murdered before the story’s beginning, is never given the opportunity to speak for himself, or even confirm or deny the many allegations surrounding him. This parallels the experience of the young, poor, and powerless in the Haitian sex tourism industry. Though they are viciously capitalized upon, they are never given the opportunity to speak for themselves or even consent to sex. Legba is objectified by every character in the story to the extent that he does not even match the description of a seventeen-year-old boy; he is described as “the fruit of good and evil” (149), a “flower” (140), “Satan personified” (148), and the “Prince of Light” (149). None of these hyperbolic descriptions are likely remotely accurate, though the narrative never describes Legba’s experience other than that he is young and poor and black. This is a metaphor for the experience of the young, black, Haitian sex worker. He is continuously exploited, with no mercy from any person with whom he interacts. Though the story is told on the premise that it is a criminal investigation of a murder, no suspect seems particularly concerned with any detail that may even remotely lead to a resolution; however, their stories are still heard in full detail. This proves that Legba’s murder, which is not taken seriously, will likely go unsolved or be forgotten, in a similar nature that power, sex, and adulthood silence the true victims of exploitation.
