    <h2>note to self</h2>
    <em>be soft.</em>
    <br></br>
i whisper in my own ear,<br></br>
be still. <br></br>
let your words be paced and velvet, like the notes on a piano.<br></br><br></br>
<em>be soft.</em>
<br></br>
softness is not synonymous with weakness;<br></br>
louder is not synonymous with stronger.<br></br>
be quiet. feel.<br></br>
<br></br>
<em>be soft.</em>
<br></br>
coarse is still beautiful,<br></br>
you are still beautiful.<br></br>
give direction to your fire.<br></br>
focus on the amber glow it emits,<br></br>
not the harsh burn of its flames.<br></br>
<br></br>
<em>be soft.</em>
<br></br>
immerse yourself in feeling, in vulnerability,<br></br>
wrap yourself in silk robes of pure gold.<br></br>
exist.<br></br></div>

  <h2>how to be racially ambiguous</h2>
  be prepared to feel alone.<br></br>
  instead of poems woven from adenine, cyosine, guanine, and thymine, <br></br>
  your DNA will form a single word: <br></br>
  enigmatic. <br></br>
  <br></br>
  be prepared to hear lots of questions and assertions. <br></br>
  lots. <br></br>
  they will ask why you look exotic, and what exactly are you, <br></br>
  and there will be a kid in your third-grade class who will obnoxiously shout <br></br>
  that it says ‘black’ on your state assessment packet and there must be some mistake. <br></br>
  the other kids will laugh. <br></br>
  <br></br>
  you’ll feel insecure that you don’t look like your family members, <br></br>
  and some days the concerned looks from the families at Denny’s when you go out with your cousins <br></br>
  will get to you. <br></br>
  you’ll spend hours in your room crying because you feel like you don’t belong. <br></br>
  <br></br>
  make sure your physical attributes are in excess:<br></br>
  your hair must be too coarse to be white, <br></br>
  but your skin must be too fair to be black, <br></br>
  and if you really want to throw them for a loop <br></br>
  make sure your eyes are green. <br></br>
  <br></br>
  I know that it isn’t easy, <br></br>
  but try not to think about the girl at your graduation party who said <br></br>
  ‘so wait... this is what your family looks like?’ <br></br>
  she was just curious. <br></br>
  they always are. <br></br></div>
